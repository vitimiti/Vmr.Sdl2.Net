Any public object must have a modern dotnet look and feel but respect SDL2's functionality as good as possible.

Use the CSharpier tool, which is included in the `dotnet-tools.json` file. Use `dotnet tool restore` to retrieve it, and
respect the `.editorconfig` style.

You may use plugins for both CSharpier and the `.editorconfig` styles to facilitate your work.

For now, most pull requests may be ignored as the project is still in its early infancy and not actually usable.
